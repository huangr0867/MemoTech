What is an air embolism?	This is a condition involving bubbles of air in the blood vessels. They can occur on a dive as shallow as 6'.

As a result, the air inside the lungs expand rapidly, causing the alveoli in the lungs to rupture.

What is decompression sickness (aka the bends)?	This occurs when bubbles of gas, especially nitrogen, obstruct the blood vessels. It results from too rapid an ascent from a dive, too long of a dive at too deep a depth, or repeated dives on the same day without the proper time intervals. During the dive, nitrogen that is being breathed dissolves in the blood and tissues because it is under pressure. When the diver ascends, the external pressure is decreased, and the dissolved nitrogen forms small bubbles within those tissues.

What is breath-holding syncope?	This is a loss of consciousness caused by a decreased stimulus for breathing. This happens to swimmers who breathe in and out rapidly and deeply before entering the water in an effort to expand their capacity to stay underwater. Whereas this technique increases the swimmer's oxygen level, the hyperventilation involved lowers the carbon dioxide level. Because an elevated level of carbon dioxide in the blood is the strongest stimulus for breathing, the swimmer may not feel the need to breathe even after using up all the oxygen in his or her lungs.

What special treatment principles should be applied to patients who have been sexually assaulted?	In addition to the usual treatment principles, in this situation you should also: 1). Document the patient's history, assessment, treatment, and response to treatment in detail because you may have to appear in court as long as 2 or 3 years later. Do not speculate.

If the patient will tolerate being wrapped in a sterile burn sheet, this may help investigators to find any hair, fluid, or fiber from the alleged offender. 5) Do not examine the genitalia unless there is major bleeding. If an object has been inserted into the vagina or rectum, do not attempt to remove it. 6) To reduce the patient's anxiety, make sure the EMT is the same sex as the patient, whenever possible. 7) Discourage the patient from bathing, voiding, or cleaning any wounds until the hospital staff has completed an assessment. Handle the patient's clothes as little as possible, placing articles and any other evidence in paper bags. If the patient insists on urinating, ask the patient to do so in a sterile urine container (if available). Also, deposit the toilet paper in a paper bag. Seal and mark the bag for the police. This can be critical evidence.

The breathing pattern in bronchitis does not indicate major airway obstruction, but the patient may experience tachypnea, an increase in the breathing rate, which is an attempt to compensate for the reduced amount of normal lung tissue and for the buildup of fluid.

What is pulmonary edema?	This is a build up of fluid between the alveoli and the pulmonary capillaries, which interferes with the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen.

What happens during a cardiac tamponade?	When this occurs, blood leaks into the tough fibrous membrane known as the pericardium, causing an accumulation of blood within the pericardial sac. This accumulation leads to compression of the heart. Because the pericardium has a limited ability to stretch, each contraction of the heart allows more blood accumulation between the heart and the sac. The accumulated blood prevents the heart from opening up to allow complete refilling.

What causes tension pneumothorax?	This is caused by damage to the lung tissue. This damage allows air normally held within the lung to escape into the chest cavity. If this condition is allowed to continue untreated, a sufficient amount of air will accumulate within the chest cavity and begin applying pressure to the structures in the mediastinum. The trapped air begins to shift the chest organs toward the uninjured side, which creates the condition.

What are some important considerations regarding a neonate's pulmonary system?	"In the group: 1) Their first breath is forceful, as they must inflate their lungs. 2) This group is particularly prone to nasal congestion, which causes upper respiratory infections.
