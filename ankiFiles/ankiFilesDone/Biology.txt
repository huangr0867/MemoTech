Oparin and Haldane	- hypothesized organic molecules formed at beginning of Earth
Miller + Urey	Proved the Oparin and Haldane hypothesis
Sidney Fox	- produced primitive protenoid microphages - part of Life on Earth theory
Heterotroph Hypothesis	- first cells were anaerobic heterotrophs 3.5 bil y.a. - multicellular animals: 565 mil y.a. - modifications lets animals move to land - mammals: 210 mil y.a. - primates: 25 mil y.a - humans: 7 mil y.a.
Modifications for Land Living (animals)	- lungs, skin, limbs, internal fertilization, shells for eggs
Mass Extinctions	- Permian and Cretacious
Permian Extinction	- 250 mil y.a. - volcano explosion in Siberia
Cretacious Explosion	- 65 mil y.a - asteroid impact - all (basically) but birds annihilated
Concepts of Evolution	- evolution can be fast (bacteria) - evolution rates differ per species - evolution can make things simple too - POPULATIONS evolve, not individuals - evolution is directed by changes in the environment
Types of Plant Tissue	- dermal, vascular, ground
Dermal Plant Tissue	- Outer protective covering of plant - on leaves, protected by cuticle and sometimes trichomes (sharp stuff) - cannot photosynthesize (no chloroplasts) except guard cells
Dermal Plant Tissue	- Outer protective covering of plant - on leaves, protected by cuticle and sometimes trichomes (sharp stuff) - cannot photosynthesize (no chloroplasts) except guard cells
Vascular Plant Tissue	- Transports water and tissue up and down plant - xylem and phloem
Ground Plant Tissue	- parenchyma, collenchyma, sclerenchyma cells
Parenchyma cells	- traditional plant cell - only one cell wall - has two large vacuoles - support plant shape - some can photosynthesize
Collenchyma Cells	- unevenly thickened cell wall (no secondary one) - only some plants have, ex) celery
Sclerenchyma cells	- very thick primary and secondary cell wall - only function is support
Xylem	- made of tracheids and vessel elements cells - carries water and nutrients UP - by transpirational pull and cohesion tension
Factors affecting rates of transpiration	- high humidity slows transpiration, low slows it down - wind reduces humidity, raised transpiration rates - higher light intensity increases photosynthesis, increasing water vapor transpiration rates - closing stomates stops transpiration
Phloem	- made of sieve tube elements and companion cells - carries sugar down from leaves - requires energy (translocation)
Plant Asexual Reproduction	- through vegetative propagation ex) cuttings, bulbs, runners
Parts of flower (sexual organ of plant)	- petals, sepals, pistils (or carpals), ovary, ovule, style, stigma, stamen, anther, filament
Petals	- modified leaves used to attract pollinators
Sepals	- greenish leaves right below petals - protects the flower during development
Pistils (Carpels)	- bulb thingy of flower, female part - contains ovary, stigma, and style
Ovary (Plants)	- fat part of pistil - where one or more ova are produced
Ovule	- actual area inside ovary where ovas are produced
Style (Plant Reproduction)	- skinny part of pistil
Stigma	- sticky top of pistil where pollen lands and fertilizes flower
Stamen	- dude part of flower, includes anther and filament
Anther	- top of stamen where pollen (sperm) is produced by meiosis
Filament (Plant)	- skinny part of stamen that supports anther
Plant Hormones	- auxins, ethylene, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid
Auxins	- enhance apical dominance - stimulates stem elongation by softening cell wall - phototropism
Cytokinins	- simulate cytokinesis and cell division - can delay aging by inhibiting protein breakdown
Gibberellins	- promote stem and leaf elongation - induce rapid growth (bolting)
Abscisic Acid	- helps plant withstand drought - closes stomates in water stress
Ethylene	- is a gas - promotes ripening -- positive feedback
Reproduction (human) process	fertilization cleavage gastrulation organogenesis
