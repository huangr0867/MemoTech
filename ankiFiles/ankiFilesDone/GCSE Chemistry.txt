Name one alternative to fossil fuels	Hydrogen is one alternative fuel. It can be used in fuel cells to power vechicles
How can you monitor the rate of a chemical reaction	We can find out the rate of a reaction by monitoring the amount of reactants used up over time. Alternatively, you can find out the rate of reation by measuring the amount of products made over time
How can you calculate the rate of reaction from a curve	To calculate the rate of reaction at a specifc time, draw the tanget to the curve, then calculate its gradient
Equation of mean rate of reaction for quantity of reactants used	mean rate of reaction = quantity of reactant used / time
Equation of mean rate of reaction for quantity of product formed used	mean rate of reaction = quantity of product formed / time
What does a steep slope on a rate of reaction graph tell you about the molecules	The steeper the slope, the faster the reaction as there is alot of product of being made in a short amount of time. This is because there is a large number of reactant molecules reacting to form the product. This means there is a large number of collisions per second
What does a gradual slope on a rate of reaction graph tell you about the molecules	A gradual slope tells us that the rate of reaction is slowing down because alot of the reactant molecules have turned into the product. This means that there are fewer reactant molecules available to react so there will be a smaller number of collions per second
What does a flat slope on a rate of reaction graph tell you aboout the molecules	At this point the reaction has as stopped this is because all the reactant molecules have already reacted. This means that the number of collisions per second is now zero
Define Collision Theory	Chemical reactions can only take place when the reacting particles collide with each other. The collisions must have sufficient energy to cause a reaction to take place
What is the rate of reaction determined by	The rate of reaction is determined by the frequency of successful collisions per second
What effect does increasing concentration of reactants have on the rate of reaction	Increasing the concentration of reactants in solution increases the frequency of collision between particles and so increases the rate of reaction. This means that the rate of reaction is proportinal to the concentration
What effect does increasing surface area of reactants have on the rate of reaction	The rate of a chemical reaction increases if the surface area to volume ratio of any solid reactant has increased. This increases the frequency of successful collisions between reacting particles
What does a large surface area : volume ratio mean	Smaller sized blocks have a greater surface area : volume ratio than larger blocks. This means that they have more particles on the surface so there are more collisions per second. This increase the rate of reaction
What effect does increasing temperature of reactants have on the rate of reaction	Increasing the temperature increases the rate of reaction because particles collide more frequently and more energetically. There would be more collisions occuring in a given time, because a higher proportion of particles have energy greater than the activation energy
What effect does using a catalyst have on the rate of reaction	Catalysts increase the rate of chemical reaction but are not used up during the reaction. When a catalyst is present, the particles require less energy to cross the activation energy barrier. This means that more particles can successfully collide per second
Why are catalysts useful for industrial processes	Catalysts are used whenever possible in industry to carry out reactions quickly without needing to increase the temperature and this reduces energy costs
Define a catalyst	Catalysts increase the rate of reaction by providing a different pathway for the reaction that has a lower activation energy
Why aren't catalysts included in chemical equations	We do not include catalysts in the chemical equation for a reaction. That is because they are not used up in the reation. Catalysts are not reactants
What effect does increasing pressure of reactants have on the rate of reaction	Increasing the pressure of reacting gases increases the frequency of collisions, and so increases the rate of reaction. This is because there are more particles of gas in a given space which increases the chance they will collide and react
Can one catalyst be used for all reactions	No, different catalysts are needed for different reactions
What is meant by a reversible reaction	In a reversible reaction, the products of the reaction can react to make the original reactants
Describe the types of reactions in reversible reactions	If a reversible reaction is exothermic in one direction, it is endothermic in the opposite direction.
Describe the energy transfers in reversible reactions	In any reversible reactions, the amount of energy transferred to the surroundings when the reaction goes in one direction is exactly equal to the energy transferred back when the reaction goes in the opposite direction
Describe the rate of reaction for a reversible reaction is a closed system	In a closed system, the rate of the forward and reverse reaction is equal at equilibrium
What is a closed system	A closed system is a sytem in which no particles can get into or out of the system, so typically a sealed vessel
What is the effect of changing conditions in a system that is equilibrium	If a system is at equilibrium and change is made to the conditions, then the system responds to counteract the change. This is called Le Chatelier's Principle
What is dynamic equilibrium	When the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction the amount of reactants and products remian constant. This is called a dynamic equilibrium
In which conditions can dynamic equilibrium occur in	A dynamic equilibrim can only occur in a closed system
What happens if you increase the temperature of a reversible reaction in a closed system	If you increases the temperature of a system, then the equilibrium shifts the endothermic side to reduce the temperature. This is because the system was at equilibrium and when change is made to the conditions, then the system responds to counteract the change
What happens if you decrease the temperature of a reversible reaction in a closed system	If you decrease the temperature of a system, then the equilibrium shifts the exothermic side to increases the temperature. This is because the system was at equilibrium and when change is made to the conditions, then the system responds to counteract the change
What happens if you increase the pressure of a reversible reaction in a closed system	If you increase the pressure on a reversible reaction at equilibrim, the position of the equilibrium shifts to the side with the smaller number of molecules
What happens if you reduce the pressure of a reversible reaction in a closed system	If you reduce the pressure on a reversible reaction at equilibrim, the position of the equilibrium shifts to the side with the larger number of molecules
What happens if you change the pressure of a reversible reaction in a closed system with the same number of moles on both sides	If we have the same number of moles on both sides, the changing pressure has no effect on the position of equilibrium
What happens if you increase the amount of reactant of a reversible reaction	If you add more reactants to a reversible reaction, the equilibrium will shift to the right to remove the reactants and make more product
What happens if you remove the amount of product of a reversible reaction	If you remove the products of a reversible reaction, the equilibrium will shift to the right to replace lost products. By continually removing product, the forward reaction can be maintained
Why are single colour indicators used instead of universal indicator	Single colour indicators are used because the end point is then very clear e.g. pink to colourless. Universal indicators have a range of colours so it is not often clear when the solution has reached its end point for example green or blue
What is Crude oil	Crude oil is a mixture of many different compounds. Most of the compounds are hydrocarbons
What are Hydrocarbons	Hydrocarbons are molecules made up of only hydrogen and carbon atoms only
What are Alkanes	Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons that contain as many hydrogen atoms as possible in their molecules
General formula for Alkanes	CnH(2n+2)
Name the first 4 Alkanes	Methane, Ethane, Propane, Butane
Describe the distillation of Crude oil	The fractional distillation of crude oil takes place in a tower called a fractionating column. Firstly, the crude oil is heated and fed into the bottom of the column as a hot vapour. The column is kept very hot at the bottom and much cooler at the top, so the temperature decreases going up the column. The gases move up the column and the hydrocarbons condese when they reach their boiling points. The liquid fractions are then removed.
How is crude oil separted	Crude oil is separted into fractions. Fractions contain a similar number of carbon atoms. This is beacuse very longer chain hydrocarbons have very higher boiling points and are removed from the bottom of the column and shorter chain hydrocarbons have very low boiling points and are removed from the top of the column
Why are short chain hydrocarbons useful	Short chain hydrocarbons make good fuels as they ignite easily and burn well, with less smoky flames, they are very flammable
How are are the hydrocabons removed from the column	Hydrocarbons with the smallest molecules have the lowest boiling points. They are piped out of the cooler top of the column as gases. At the bottom of the column, the fractions have high boiling points. They cool to form very thick liquid or soilds at room temperature
What are feedstock	A feedstock is a chemical that is used to make other chemicals and sre used for the petrochemical industry
Describe the viscousity of Crude oil	As the size of the hydrocarbon molecules increases the molecules get more viscous
Describe flammability of  Hydrocarbons	As the size of the hydrocarbon molecules increases, the hydrocarbon becomes less flammable. Long chain hydrocarbons are very difficult to burn
Describe the boiling point of hydrocarbon	As the size of the hydrocarbon molecules increases, the boiling point also increases. Very long chain hydrocarbon have very high boiling points
How do Hydrocarbons provide energy	Hydrocarbon fuel releases energy when combusted. During combustion the carbon and hydrogen atoms in the fuel react with oxygen. The carbon and hydrogen are oxidised. If the oxygen is unlimited, this reaction produces carbon dioxide and water and this is called complete combustion
Balanced Equation of the complete combustion of propane	C3H8(g)+ 5O2(g) = 3CO2(g) + 4H2O(g)
What is incomplete combustion	When there isn't enough oxygen during the combustion hydrocarbons, eg inside an engine, there is incomplete combustion. Instead of all the carbon in the fuel turning into CO2, carbon monxide gas, is also formed. Carbon monoxide is a toxic gas
Why is carbon monoxide gas toxic to humans	Carbon monoxide is a colourless and odourless toxic gas. Red blood cells bind to the gas and carry it around in your blood instead of oxygen

What are the products of craking hydrocarbons	Cracking produces saturated hydrocarbons, which are used as fuels, and unsaturated hydrocarbons called alkenes, which are used to make polymers and chemicals
Why are large hydrocarbons cracked	Large hydrocarbons are not in high demand, as they are difficult to vaporise and do not burn easily making them poor fuels
How do you test for alkenes	Alkenes will turn orange bromine water colourless
How can we distinguish alkenes and alkanes	Alkenes are more reactive then alkanes, so a reaction with bromine water is used to test the hydrocarbon. If the hydrocarbon turns the orange bromine water colourless than the hydrocarbon is an alkene. Alkanes do not react with bromine water

What is a homologus series	A family of organic compounds with the same functional group is called a homologus series
Describe the combustion of alkenes	Combusting an alkene produes carbon dioxide and water and also unburnt carbon particles because of incomplete combustion. Alkenes burn in air with a smoky yellow flame. They also release less energy per mole in combustion compared to alkanes, so are not used as fuels
Equation of ethene reacting with bromine	C2H4 + Br2 = C2H4Br2
What are the products of reacting an alkene with hydrogen	Reacting an alkene with hydrogen produces an alkane
Describe the hydration of ethene	Ethene gas can be cracked to react with steam to make ethonal. The reaction requires energy to heat the gases and to generate a high pressure. The temperature must be around 300oC and the pressure around 70 atmosphere. Phosphoric acid is used as a cataylast and the reaction is reversible. To increase the yield of ethanol, any unreacted ethene and steam are passed back through the catalyst
How do alkenes react	Alkenes react with halogens, hydrogen and water by adding atoms across the carbon double bond, forming a saturated molecule
What is the functional group of alcohols	The homologous series of alcohols contain the OH functional group
What are the advantage and disavantage of producing ethonal by hydration	One advantage of producing ethanol by hydrating ethene is that the reaction produces a high yield of ethanol. However the reation requires a high temperature and the ethene comes from non-renewable crude oil
Describe an alternative way to make ethanol	In fermentation, a sugar solution such as glucose can be mixed with yeast. The yeast coverts the sugar solution to a solution of ethonal. Carbon dioxide gas is also produced. The temperature should be around 30oC. The reation must take place in anaerobic conditions
What are the advantages and disadvantages of producing ethanol my fermentation	The low temperature means that he reaction does not require a lot of energy. The sugar for this reaction comes from plants and is therefore renewable. However the product would be an aqeous solution of ethanol, which has to be distilled and that requires energy
Describe the solubility of alcohols in water	Alcohols are soluble in water and form neutral solutions. As the number of carbon atoms increases, the solubility decreases
Describe the reaction of alcohols with sodium	Alcohols react with sodium metal to form a solution of sodium alkoxide and hydrogen gas is given off
Describe the oxidation of an alcohol	When alcohols react with oxidising agents, such as potassium dichromate, they produce a carboxylic acid and water. The same reaction takes place if the ethanol is left exopsed to the air. Microbes in the air produce ethonic acid from ethanol
Describe the combustion of alcohols	Alcohols release energy when combusted. Combusting an alcohol in air produces carbon dioxide and water
How are alcohols used	Alcohols are used as solvents and fuels and ethonal is the main alcohol in alcoholic drinks.
What is the funtional group of the carboxylic acids	The homologous series of carboxylic acids contain the -COOH functional group
General Word Equation of acid reacting with metal carbonate	Metal carbonate + acid = salt + water + carbon dioxide
Why are carboxylic acids called weak acids	Carboxylic acids only partially ionise their H+ ions in aqueous solutions. The reaction is also reversible so, some of the ions recombine to form the orginal molecule. Therefore their is a higher concentration of H+ ions in strong acids than in carboxylic acids given the same concentration
Describe the reaction of ethanoic acid and sodium carbonate	The reaction of ethanoic acid and sodium carbonate produces the salt sodium ethanoate, carbon dioxide gas and water
What are the products of carboxylic acids reacting with alcohols	Carboxylic acids react with alcohols to produce esters and water in a reversible reaction in the presence of a strong acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid
How are esters useful	Esters have a distintive smells because they are volatile (evaporate easily). This makes them ideal for use in perfumes and food flavourings
How are polymers made	A polymer is made by joining together thousands of small, identical molecules called monomers. The monomer molecules are joined together to form the polymer
What type of monomers are used to create addition polymers	In addition polymers, the monomers are alkenes. Monomers have a double carbon to carbon bond which is replaced by a single carbon to carbon bond when the polymers form. This is called addition polymerisation
What are plastics made from	The plastics used in everyday life are made up of huge covalently bonded molecules made from lots of small monomer molecules joined together.
What is a condensation polymer	Condensation polymers are made from monomers. In condesation polymer, the monomers are not alkenes. When these monomers react, small molecules are lost such as water or hydrogen chloride
State the differences between addition and condensation polymers	In addition polymerisation, there is only one product formed in the reaction, the polymer, whereas in condensation polymerisation there are two different products. The main product is the polymer, but there is a small molecule being given off such as water or hydrogen chloride
General word equation to make a polyester	Diol + Dicarboxylic acid = Polyester + water
How are condensation polymers formed	Condensation polymers are formed by two different monomers. Each monomer has two of the same functional groups
How are polyesters formed	To make a polyester you would react one diol monomer with an OH group at each end and a dicarboxylic acid monomer with a COOH group at each end. The monomers link together as they polymerise by ester links and a water molecule is given off
What do monosaccharides polymerise to make	Simple carbohydrates such as monosaccharides polymerise to make polymers such as starch and cellulose
What are amino acids	Amino acid molecules have two different functional groups which commonly are from the amine group and the carboxylic acid group. Amino acids can react to form a condensation polymer due to the two different functional and they also produce water

What are the conditions in which low density polyethene is formed	Low density polyethene, which is used to make plastic bags, polymerises at high temperature and pressure.
What happens when thermosoftening polymers are heated	Thermosoftening polymer soften and melt when heated. This is because the individual chains of the polymer are held together by weak intermolecular forces. When heated, these bonds break, allowing the chains to slide over one another.
What happens when you heat thermosetting polymers	Thermosetting polymers do not soften when heated. This is because the individual chains of the polymer are joined together with cross links, which are covalent bonds between the chains. As these bonds are of similar strength to all of the other covalent bonds present, strong heating will result in chemical decomposition of the polymer, rather than reversible melting.
What is condensation polymerisation	Condensation polymerisation involves monomers with two functional groups. When these types of monomers react they join together, usually losing small molecules such as water, and so the reactions are called condensation reactions.
What are polypeptides	Polypeptides are the main component of proteins. They are short chains of amino acid monomers linked by peptide bonds.
What is DNA made from	DNA is made up from monomers called nucleotide
Describe the structure of DNA	DNA molecules consist of a double helix made up of two long polymer strands of nucleotides and are held in place by intermolecular forces down the length of the strand.There are four different nucleotide monomers that can react with each other to form DNA polymer.
What are nucleotides	The nucleotides are based on the sugar deoxyribose, bonded to a phospatye group and a base. There are four possible bases that bond to the sugar. These are adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine
What does DNA stand for	Deoxyribonucleic acid
The Harber process takes place at 450oC, under 200 atmospheric pressure in the presence of an iron catalyst. The ammonia made is regularly condesed and removed.                                                                             N2(g) + 3H2(g) <=> 2NH3(g)   Explain why these conditions and processes are in place, identifying clearly the compromises made                                                                                                    [6 marks]	The reaction is exothermic so a low temperature would shift the equilibrium to the right. However this would slow down the rate of reaction so a compromise is used to ensure the particles have the minimum amount of energy required to collide. A high pressure is used as it speeds up the rate of the reaction as there are more reacting particles in a given volume. It also shifts the equilibrium to the right as there are 4 moles on the left and 2 on the right. A catalyst is used as it speeds up the rate of both the forward and reverse reaction without getting used up. This makes it a cheap way to increase the rate. A catalyst provides an alternative path with a lower activation energy. Ammonia is removed as this will drive the reation in the forward direction, increasing the yield

The closer your measured vaule is to the actual melting and boiling points, the purer your sample is
How do impurties affect the melting and boiling points of a sample	Impurities in your sample will lower the melting points and increase the melting range of a substance. Impurities in your sample will also increase the boiling point and may result in your sample boiling at a range of temperatures
What is a formulation	Formulations are useful mixtures, made up in definite proportions, designed to give a product the best properties possible to carry out its function

How can you distinguish between a pure and impure substance using chromatography	Given an unknown organic solution, chromatography can usually tell you if it is a single compound or a mixture. If the unknown sample is a mixture of compounds, there will probably be more than one spot formed onthe chromatogram. On the other hand a single spot indicates the possiblity of a pure substance
Equation of Retention factor	Rf = distance moved by substance / distance moved by solvent
What is the Retention factor	An Rf value is the ratio between the distance travelled by the dissloved substance and the distance travelled by the solvent

Why won't flame tests work with a mixture of metal ions	If the sample being tested contains a mixture of metal ions, then some flame colours can be masked.
How can you test for metal cations	Reacting unknown compounds with sodium hydroxide solution can help you identify some positive ions as many metal hydroxides are insoulbe and precipitate out of solution when formed
Which metal ion solutions turn white when you add sodium hydroxide	Aluminium ions, calcium ions and magnesium ions all form white percipitates when sodium hydroxide solution is added
How can you distinguish aluminium, calcium and magnesium solutions	If you add excess sodium hydroxide, then the precipitate formed with aluminium ions dissovles. However, the white precipitate formed with calcium or magnesium ions will not dissoljve. Flame tests can be used to distinguish between calcium or magnesium ions

Ionic Equation of barium chloride reacting with sulfate ions	Ba2+ + SO42-(aq) => BaSO4(s)
How does Flame Emission Spectroscopy work	During flame emisson spectroscopy a sample is placed in a flame. As the ions heat up, their electrons become exicted. When the electrons drop back to their orginal energy levels, they can transfer energy as light. The light passes through a spectroscope, which can detect different wavelengths of light to produce a line spectrum
What does the wavelength in a spectroscopy depend on	The combination of wavelengths emmitted by an ion depends on its charge and its electron arrangement. Different ions emit different wavelengths of light. So each ion produces a different pattern of wavelengths and has a different line spectrum
What does the intensity of light indicate in spectroscopy	The intensity of the spectrum indicates the concentration of the ion in the solution. This means that line spectrums can be used to identify ions in solution and calculate their concentrations
Which substance can Flame emmission spectroscopy work on	Flame emmission spectroscopy can be used to identify different ions in mixtures. This makes them more useful than flame tests

Student wants to increase rate of reaction, and decides to try two techniques:   1. Increasing the volume of the reaction vessel 2. Increasing the temperture at which the reaction is carried out    Explain using collision theory, whether or not these changes will increase the rate of reaction	Increasing the volume of the reaction vessel would decrease the pressure of the gases. So the particles would be more spread out and would collide less frequently, so the rate of reaction would decrease. Increasing the temperature would cause the particles to move faster, so the frequncy of successful collisions and the rate of reaction will increase
How was the earth's early atomsphere formed	The earth's early atomsphere was formed by volcanic activity
Which gases formed the Earth's early atomsphere	The early atomsphere consisted of mostly carbon dioxide with little or no oxygen. There may have also been nitrogen and water vapour, together with traces of methane and ammonia
Which proportions of gases formed the modern atmosphere	Around 78% of the atmosphere is nitrogen and around 21% is oxygen. There are also small proportions of gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapour and noble gases such as argon
Why can't scientist be sure about the composition of the Earth's early atmosphere	The earth is around 4600 millions years old and that means that scientists cannot be certain about the early atomsphere
Suggest two possible sources of the water that collected to form the early oceans	The water vapour in the atmosphere condensed as the Earth gradually cooled down and fell as rain. Another theory speculates that comets could also have brought water to the Earth increasing the to its water supply
How did the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere increase	Bacteria and other simple organisms such as algae, evolved and could use the energy from the sun to make their own food by photosynthesis, producing oxygen gas as a waste product. As plants evolved, they successfully colonised most of the Earth's surfaces and so the atmosphere became richer with oxygen.
How did the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere decrease	The carbon dioxide from the atmosphere dissolved in the oceans, where it reacted with minerals to form insoluble carbonates, such as calcium carbonate, that formed sediments on the seabed. It was also taken in by animals to become a part of skeletons and shells and swhen the animal dies, this becomes a sedimentary rock Some CO2 was used in photosynthesis to make oxygen.
Explain how the levels of oxygen on the earth increased and why this was important                                                                            [6 marks]	The first organisms photosynthesized, using carbon dioxide and water and made oxygen gas and glucose which was used for respiration. These simple organisms evolved into the first marine plants and then land plants, the increasing numbers of photosynthetic organisms further increased the levels of oxygen in atmosphere and eventually their was sufficient oxygen to support living organisms to evolve so that they did not rely on photosynthesis for energy. These organisms fed on algae and plants and could release energy stored in them by using oxygen gas in the process of respiration
Why did scientist believe that there was no life on Earth during the first billion years of the earth's existance	As there was no liquid water because temperature too hot for organisms to survive
How was the ammonia and methane removed form the atmopshere	Any ammonia and methane was removed by reactions with oxygen, once oxygen had been formed by photosythesis
explain the orgins of nitrogen and why its composition of the air is high	Nitrogen gas was produced by volcanoes in the early atmosphere, along with traces of ammonia gas, the ammonia reacted with oxygen to form more nitrogen gas and the levels of nitrogen gas remained high because it is very unreactive
How is coal formed	If ferns or trees die in marshy wetlands, they don’t decompose due to a lack of oxygen or acidic conditions, over time the remains are covered in sediment and compressed, a high temperature and pressure create coal
How is Crude oil formed	Plankton die and settle in the sea bed and no there is no oxygen to decompose, overtime they’re compressed by sediment and heat and pressure convert them into crude oil
How is natural gas formed	Mainly the hydrocarbon methane, you can find them in deposits of oil because it’s formed by plankton in a similar way to crude oil
Why has the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere risen	The amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere has risen in the recent past, largely due to the amount of fossil fuels now burnt
What are the three greenhouse gases	Carbon dioxide, Methane and Water vapour
