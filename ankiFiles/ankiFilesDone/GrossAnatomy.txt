Autonomic nervous system	Part of the peripheral nervous system composed of visceromotor nerves that innervate smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, or glands.  Function is to regulate bodily response not under voluntary/congitive control: 1. Responses to emergencies (fight or flight) 2. Replacing bodily reserves and eliminating waste (rest and digest)  Types: 1. Sympathetic pre- and post-ganglionic nerves 2. Parasympathetic pre- and post-ganglionic nerves
Body wall	Consists of: 1. Skin 2. Limbs 3. Thoracic and abdominal walls (skin, bones, mucles) 4. External genitalia 5. Spine 6. Parietal layers of the serous cavities, diagraphm
Sympathetic subdivision of ANS	Controls responses to emergencies (fight or flight)
Parasympathetic subdivision of ANS	Regulates restoration of the bodily reserves (rest and digest). Only innervates viscera, not body walls.
Sympathetic axons: functions and targets	Innervate all regions of the body in order for nerve impulses to travel quickly (for emergencies).  Sympathetic axons innervate 1. Sweat glands, arrector pili muscles, and smooth muscles around arteries in the skin (part of cutaneous nerves). 2. Smooth muscle lining arteries of skeletal muscles (including diaphragm) 3. Smooth muscle of viscera (GI, etc.), its arteries, and its glands
Parasympathetic axons & targets	Within the thorax, parasympathetic axons course within the vagus nerve to innervate:  1. Cardiac muscle 2. Smooth muscle lining coronary arteries, aorta, esophagus, and  tracheobronchial tree 3. Smooth muscle lining arteries to penis, clitoris, and vas deferens.
Origins of pre-ganglionic ANS neurons	All neurons of ANS originate within the spinal cord.  Pre-ganglionic sympathetic cell bodies arise from T1 to L1/L2 spinal cord segments (between cervical and lumbar enlargements).  Pre-ganglionic parasympathetic cell bodies arise from brainstem (cranial outflow above cervical enlargement) or spinal cord segments S2-S4 (sacral outflow below lumbar enlargement)
Two-neuron system: Sympathetic NS	1. Sympathetic pre-ganglionic cell bodies are located in the lateral horn of the spinal cord (T1-L2).  2. Myelinated axons leave the spinal cord segment and travel to the sympathetic ganglion (sympethetic trunk ganglia or preaortic ganglia, if anterior to aorta).  3. They synapse onto as many as 30 unmyelinated adrenergic post-ganglionic neurons (amplification!), which travel to innervate target (epinephrine/norephinephrine, or cholinergic for sweat glands).
Two-neuron system: Parasympathetic NS	1. Pre-ganglionic cell bodies are located in the brainstem or grey matter of S2-S4.  2. Long preganglionic axons leave the spinal cord and travel to parasympathetic ganglion near target organ.  3. They synapse onto 2-5 short, cholinergic (acetylcholine) postganglionic neurons that innervate the target organ (typically the axons are embedded in the target organ).
Sympathetic trunk and chain ganglia	Sympathetic trunks extend from base of skull to tip of coccyx on each side of the vertebral column. Regions: 1. Cervical (3 ganglia for 8 spinal nerves) 2. Thoracic (12 ganglia) 3. Lumbar (5) 4. Sacral (5)  Functions: 1. Ganglia are site where pre- and post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons synapse. 2. Conduits to distribute post-ganglionic sympathetics to spinal nerves. 3. Give rise to splanchnic nerves that distribute sympathetics to internal organs (viscera).
Sympathetic pathway details	1. Pre-ganglionic axon exits spinal cord via ventral root (T1-L2), enters the spinal nerve, and takes the ventral ramus.  2. The axon exits the ventral ramus quickly and takes the myelinated white communicating ramus to the sympathetic ganglion within the sympathetic trunk.  3. Post-ganglionic axons can either  (a) move through the sympathetic trunk and eventually exit via grey communicating rami (at all spinal cord levels) back to the spinal nerve. They can then take the dorsal ramus or ventral ramus to reach their target.  (b) exit trunk ganglia through splanchic nerves that innervate thoracic viscera.
Parasympathetic pathway details	Post-ganglionic axons only innervate viscera (except for arteries of penis and clitoris, and smooth muscle of pupil).  In order to innervate thoracic viscera: 1. Preganglionic axons travel through the vagus nerve, which branches off the brainstem (where the preganglionic cell bodies are located) 2. Vagus descends through the neck and enters the thorax and into the abdominal cavity. 3. Axons can split off from the vagus in splanchic nerves to reach various parasympathetic ganglia near target organs.
