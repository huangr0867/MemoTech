Function of a plasmid	enable bacteria to develop antibiotic resistance, synthesize bacteriocins, exotoxins
Mechanism that can help with antibiotic resistance	Increase efflux of antibiotic, decrease uptake of antibiotics, alter the target site of the antibiotic, destroy the antibiotic directly
Increase efflux of antibiotic	whenever it enters the cell the bacteria pumps it back out
Decrease uptake of antibiotics	antibiotics must enter cell via a pore on the cell surface, bacteria will change the structure of the pore to prevent the anti-biotic from entering the cell
Alter the target site of the antibiotic	Bacteria alter stucture so that antibiotics no longer work,  Ex: rancomycin targets NAM crosslinks = bacteria change structure
Destroy the Antibiotic directly	produce and secrete an enzyme to digest the antibiotic such as penicillin

Life cycle of a bacteriophage	lytic infection and lysogenic infection
Lytic infection	bacteriophage infects bacteria --> reproduces a thousand times -->bacteria is lysed to release all the bacteriophages  -parasitic relationship
Lysogenic infection	bacteriophage infects bacteria--> integration of bacteriophage DNA inot the bacteria's genome--> replication of the cell will also replicate the bateriophage
Lysogenic infection in a bad environment	the bacteriophage will pop out of the DNA of the bacteria genome and go into a lytic phase
What disease is capable of producing a lysogenic infection?	HIV
What type of relationship is a Lysogenic infection?	commensalistic relationship
What happens when a bacteriophage has a bacterial exotoxin gene in their genome?	Once the bacteriophage inserts itselt into the DNA the of the bacteria the bacteria is able to produce that exotoxin  this is a mutualistic relationship
Why is an exotoxin beneficial to bacteriophage?	Because everytime the bacteria spreads so does the bacteriophage
Why are bacteriophages hard to treat?	they are very specific, you have to know the exact genus and species of microbe your patient is infected with in order to treat
